## General info
---
This project was designed to teach us the following about React:
* Implement user-friendly UI and React components
* Manage state of various UI elements
* Validate form content in conjunction with state of other components
* Practice communicating project specifications 
* Practice communicating technical decisions you made

We were instructed to refactor the code and add our own improvements. I started fresh from a create react app and used some code from the previous assignment, but mostly restructured it, created the UI, and tried to simulate a real ATM.
